# YINSH

Yinsh is a two-player abstract-strategy board game on a hexagonal grid containing 85 intersection points. Each player is given 5 rings â€“ either black or white. 51 markers are black on one side and white on the other side.

Stages of the Game:
1. **Ring Placement** - White goes first, placing a white ring anywhere on the board. Players alternate turns, playing each of their five rings on the board.
2. **Marker and Ring Mechanic** - Once all ten rings are placed on the board, a player places a marker in any of their rings. The marker must have their corresponding color facing up. Then, they can move that ring along the lines of the board, granting them three axes to move along. Rings cannot jump over other rings. Rings can jump over other markers but must land in the immediate open space after a row of markers, and this causes the markers to flip colors.
3. **Five-in-a-Row** - When there are five markers in a row of the player's color, they are removed off the board, and you pick any one of your rings to remove off the grid and into the scoring section. If your move caused two intersecting five-in-a-rows, you pick any of the two to take off the board. If your move caused two non-intersecting five-in-a-rows of your color, you remove both off the board, and you remove two rings to take off the board. If you caused your opponent to gain five-in-a-row, your opponent must take them off the board at the start of their next turn.
4. **End** - Whoever takes three of their rings off the board first wins the game. If all 51 markers are used up, the winner is whoever took most of their rings off the board. If they have an equal number of rings, the game ends in a draw.
